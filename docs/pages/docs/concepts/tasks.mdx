## What is a Task

A task can be any long-running process that runs in the background. An example is a cron job or a worker that processes items from a queue. But they can also be more complicated like an item that is being processed in serial by multiple workers jumping between multiple queues.

A task has a clear start and end. These can be in the same process or in multiple. A task could take a few minutes to run or it may take a couple of days.

Taskeera makes it easy to track the progress of these tasks.
